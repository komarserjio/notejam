**The easy way to learn web frameworks**

Do you know framework X and want to try framework Y?
The easy way to start with a new framework is to compare it with frameworks you already know.
The goal of the project is to help developers easily learn new frameworks by examples.

Notejam is a unified sample web application (more than just "Hello World") implemented using different server-side frameworks.
Currently python, php, ruby and javascript frameworks are supported.
